## Task(s)
### Description of project:
Design and implement a human face recognition system that can recognize a person. You may collect
100+ faces from your group and others and build the face database with the PCA approach. For training, the face images are typically from 100x100 to 300x250.

The face detection algorithm from OpenCV/Python/MATLAB/C++ can be called, providing face location
and size. The detected faces will be resized to the same size as you did during the training process. You may use image enhancement techniques to improve face image quality. The pre-processed face will then be fed into the recognition program that you have designed for recognition.

### Assessment: 
1. The database should contain a minimum of 100 faces, one mark will be deducted for one face short. Each cropped face image should be named with the personâ€™s name. Or an index file can be used to identify each face.
2. The database must have more than 20 people.
3. During the demonstration/presentation, you should show the ability of face recognition of the program with PCA. For example, by giving a new face (not trained in the database), the program should be able to tell the name of this face. Note that error is allowed.
4. Maximum of 10 images are allowed for each team member.
5. The CA comprises of one report for each team. The report should have details of the algorithm design/list/test results, and performance analysis. There is no page limit. Everyone must submit the report via Moodle. Identify individual contributions in the report.
